# Allen Maxwell Portfolio

This my portfolio using Bootstrap. 

There is an About Me section which contains a couple paragraphs summarizing my day to day life, hobbies, and activities.

There is a Portfolio section which showcases some of my hobbies and links to other projects I've completed. 
  - Some of these projects include an app called Newbee. This was a group project I collaborated on and am very excited about. In this app, it uses your geolocation to pinpoint events within a 22 mile radius of your current location. Pretty cool, right? You can search sporting events, concerts and even comedy shows. You can then save those events and/or click the link to find tickets. 
  - There are also a few games within this portfolio as well. I created a Rock N' Roll theme Hangman game. You only have 10 guesses to guess the correct band name, so good luck!
  - There is also a few quirkie apps such as the movie gif finder. Select a movie on the title list or enter your own favorite movie, click the title and out comes a few gifs related to that movie. You can click them to pause and play.
  - There are a few more apps, but I don't want to spoil any surprises, so go on and have a look. 
  
There is also a Contact Me section which is where you can write your name, email, and a brief message.

Thanks for stopping by!
